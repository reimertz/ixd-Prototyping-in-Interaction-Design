Assignment 7 - Video Prototype
=========================

I really like being creative, so I was very excited about the the video-prototyping workshop.The lack of boundaries when you work with videos is very motivating.

After a discussion on what to do, we decided on to use the anti-stress-band idea since we had a lot of accessories such that we created in an earlier workshop, such as a wrist band, a lego-based story-board and a app prototype that you could hold in your hand.
I think this was a good choice since we could focus more on the actual prototyping than having
to come up with ideas for each of the videos that we had to record.

It was very easy for us to decide what kind of videos we wanted to record since we already
had really good accessories. This is what we decided on doing:

* Live performers video (using the wrist-band and phone app prototype)
* Stop-motion video (using lego story board scene)
* Wireframe walk-trough 

It was very interesting to work on the storyboard for the stop-motion video. Since
we had an office scene, we felt that it would be a nice explain how the anti-stress-band
could improve the relationship between workers and their managers since this could be 
a lot of tension and stress there. I like that w
e had a document where we wrote everything
instead of doing stuff ad-hoc since stop-motions are very hard to edit after you have recorded
a scene. 

I spent much time working on the live performers video together with Malin. We did more 
of a manus-script for that video, deciding location and what to say. But that was basically 
it. So when we started to record the video, it became obvious that we had set our standards very high, but without doing proper planning. So we had to do a lot of ad-hocing which was time-consuming. For me, that wouldn't been a problem because I think a lot of good ideas
comes from situations where you make stuff up on the fly, but because of the time constrain, 
it all just felt frustrating after a while. To add more fuel to the fire, we had a pretty dis-functional group and it felt that some persons kind of didn't contribute, but instead stalled the progress. This was very frustrating since I felt  more and more how
we wouldn't have time to finish any of the movies.

The editing of our videos, which we had set a goal to start with one hour before the presentations, was very frustrating for me as well. I had to spend a lot of time
exporting our stop-motion pictures into a video which was took a lot of time, mainly because software we used to take the pictures didn't use incremental naming which made it
impossible to use with Premiere Pro. Once I had fixed that, we realized that none of us
had worked with Premier Pro prior to the workshop and at this moment we had 35 minutes until
the presentations. I kind of have up at this moment since I had been stressed all day. 

I took this failure very hard, since circumstances that I couldn't control at the time,
made it impossible for us to finish on time. But still, I'm very happy with the result of the weekend editing that we did. 

Lessons learned from this experience is: Better time scheduling, workshop prototype â‰  real life product and it is better to be honest with what you feel and tell others about it since this is the most honest and effective way of getting a functional group.
