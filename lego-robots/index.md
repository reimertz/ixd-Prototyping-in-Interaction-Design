Assignment 1 - Lego Robots
=========================

## Analyze time constraints and complexity of the problem


I spent a large amount of my childhood playing with lego, and the beauty with it was
that you didn't have to follow any step-by-step guide to build something. You just used your 
creativity and imagination to build whatever you wanted. With that in mind, and that Lego Mindstorms is designed for anyone who is 10 years and older, it's easy to assume that the complexity of building a robot from scratch is a slamdunk and doable for anyone. We couldn't be more wrong.

After an hour or building, and maybe 15 minutes of panic, we realized that this was not like lego at all. Parts had to be carefully connected to maintain a reasonable structure that could handle the stress from the motors. So we had to rebuild it from scratch, and follow the step-by-step guide from the manual to get it right. Lesson learned is that if you are doing something for the first time, analyze the complexity, and don’t trust assumptions based on unrelated situations.

## How 30 lines of code could create love

I'm amazed how easy it is to project feelings onto a big mess of cables and lego bricks. It was most obvious when we created the attractive/repulsive robots. With 30 lines of code, we created a complex love affair between two robots. It makes sense since It’s easier to relate to something if you can assume that it is like you, with a soul and body.  In 100 years, who know how complex computers will be? I don’t think it’s unreasonable that we will walk next to robots, that we once created, that will have a soul just like we have, because of the nature of programming and the evolutional velocity of computational complexity.

## Trivial problems could become complex in groups
It is always interesting to work in groups, since this can give you 

* different points of view
* a wide variety of skills
* increased velocity
* higher quality

In order for this to work, a group need to be comfortable with each other so that problems could be broken down into definable tasks and assigned to the person(s) with the most appropriate  skillset. For me this was very frustrating because I just came from an internship where velocity was the main priority and decisions had to be made quickly and where no one was afraid of stepping on each others feets because nothing was personal.

On the workshop, a trivial problem, like building the robot(with the step-by-step guide) took a lot of time, since everybody need be a part of the process, and you don’t want anyone to be excluded because of gender or prior knowledge. I guess this is a problem that will disappear when we all get to know each other better and have assignments that are over a longer period of time.
