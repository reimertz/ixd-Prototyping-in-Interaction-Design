Assignment 3 - Screen-based prototyping
=========================

## Finding that perfect idea

We went to one of the circular rooms to get some inspiration. Being super excited
about this task, we started to brainstorm to come up with an idea, and we went all over the place.

* Interactive windshield in self-driven cars
* Windows with led-bars
* Car-enabled HUD-glasses that synced with the car
* Rear windshield with led-bars
* A micro phone (a smart-phone with a small display)

We spent a long time discussing these ideas, going back and forth on what was the most
interesting idea. Personally, I really wanted to work on the ***"Interactive windshield in self-driven cars"*** since i strongly believe this is the future. Human-caused errors stand for a majority of the deaths
in traffic, so it's natural that we will come up with ways to get rid of our selfs as a parameter while
driving. Anyway, since we all where really innovative and came up with more and more ideas, it was hard 
to settle on a particular one. 

#### Spending too much time

After 2 hours, with some help of one of the teachers, we realized that we had to hurry up since we needed
to iterate a few prototypes before testing them on other groups, so we chose ***"Car-enabled HUD-glasses that synced with the car"***.

After deciding, we spent a lot of time discussing what the glasses should be able to do and how they should do it. I think the reason was that we all shared the mentality that it is important to fell that you do something useful. And this can be troublesome if you are a person, with a lot of ideas, that get asked to develop an idea quickly. So after getting reminded againg that we really needed to hurry up, we 
made these requirements. 

* Sync with the car
* Have three view
  * Driving
  * Navigation (google maps)
  * Media
* Always show important data(in all views), km/h,rpm, temperature, etc.
## "Let's do everything!"

## Prototyping

We quickly decided to do these three prototypes

###A Photoshop-based HUD-layer

###A paper prototype

###An iPad-based storyboard

### Testing - "OMG OMG, we have nothing!"

At this moment, we freaked out. We saw that other groups had a really good idea on what they were supposed
to do, while we kind of forgot that we should do some kind of tests on other groups.

Our iPad storyboard turned out to be pretty useless, the paper prototypes that
was kind of stressed together was in a similar shape since it was not made to be tested. 

Luckily, our Photoshop hero saved us. He had been working kind of quietly while the rest us stressed
out and built a very beautiful, well-structured Photoshop document that we all realized could be 
used as a way of testing our ideas.

After this point, with all the stress flushed out, we managed to come up with two valid 
tests.

#### Test 1: Venn-categorization

The first thing we did was to introduce the subject to our idea of replacing
the need of a dashboard with a pair of interactive glasses.

After that, we asked them to place a bunch(roughly 40) of features written
on post-its into a venn-diagram containing 3 circles:
  * Car
  * Navigation
  * Media

Due to the nature of a venn-diagram, the subject had the possibility to put them in 1, 2 our 3
circles where we defined the middle as Important, meaning that if that wanted something
to be visible at all times, they should put it there.

This was very interesting since this gathered a lot of interesting information such as
the need of a fourth category.

#### Test 2: Blind-piloting
After the first test, we let them sit infront of a screen and the only thing we told
them was that all interactions was made by saying "glasses".

**Here is a short version of one the tests:**
