Assignment 6 - LARP
=========================

LARP .aka. Live action role-playing game, was pretty interesting. Sadly, because of the time limit, it was hard for me connect with the character I was supposed to play. And it was obvious that all members of my group felt the same way. Surely, the initial discussion we had in groups divided by the personality you where supposed to play was helpful but I think
it would have been more effective if we instead where divided into the final groups right away so we could have discussed and planned the situation.

I think the main conflict in our group was that the inventor, instead on focusing in one idea,
had a bunch of ideas. That made it hard for us to maintain a reasonable discussion since no
pitch talk would be about a bunch if ideas. This is something i believe would have been solved
if we would discussed the situation a bit before playing our roles.

It was troublesome that the "new guy at work" was a very weak personality and didn't get as much room as the other personalities in our group. Since I was the skeptical personality, and naturally became one of the leaders, I decided to promote the new guy so he had
as much responsibility as the rest of us and could be a part of the discussions more easily.
