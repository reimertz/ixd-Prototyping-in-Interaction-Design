3D modeling

### LegoChain

The simple idea is that you should be able to attach a lego character to
the red thing. The pipes are a bit longer to make sure that that the 
lego character doesn't fall off. 

This whole thing will then be connected to a keychain so that you can
brag about your lego dude while walking around the streets.
