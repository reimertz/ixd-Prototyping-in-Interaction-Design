## A Swedish Passport (in progress)

![](/design-processes/images/passport.jpg)

### Preparations
My group decided to use a the newly updated Swedish passport as the artifact, which was interesting
since it had a lot of new features, such as increased security, more sturdy design and
pictures of Swedish cities!

After randomly deciding who's going to be who in the role playing, we started.
I got to be the journalist, interestingly, I choose to be a journalist with a a skeptical
point of view, I also chose to have some insider information that I could confront the designers with.

### The interview
It was interesting, the designers spent some time discussing the value of security and how
that was their clients(the Swedish government) highest priority. I asked them about the amount
if visible faces on the passport and asked if Swedish people are more egocentric than others, 
they said maybe. They mentioned that they spent some time making it usable for people with disabilities,
such as blind people with the help of making the most important page out of very distinct plastic.

The researcher asked a about the designing process and what specific methods they used when the
redesigned the passport, they couldn't name any specific method, but the said that they iterated
a a lot on different ideas and brainstormed.

That was basically it.
