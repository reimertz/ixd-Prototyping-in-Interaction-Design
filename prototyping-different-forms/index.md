Assignment 2 - Prototyping Different Forms
=========================

## The Idea

By creating a wrist-band that measures their stress level, we hope to help adults and/or parents and their kids in stressful environments to overcome stress. Friends and family will be able to follow each other through a companion mobile app.

## From Idea to a prototype

### Prototyping methods

We decided to use a bunch of different prototyping methods to get as much out workshop as possible:

* Text-based Scenarios
* Flowchart
* Venn-Diagram
* UML-Diagram
* Paper prototypes
* Storyboard
* Foam model
* Action figures with cardboard models
* Dramatization

We also decided to played around with as many materials as possible to get a feeling of what we wanted to do and how the actual product should look like. 

### Playing around > Text based prototyping

It was very interesting that all methods related to writing(Venn-diagram, UML-diagram, Text-based scenarios) quickly felt boring, this was probably because we knew that we where about to foam models, dramatization and paper prototypes, so we quickly abandoned that form of prototyping. As soon as we started more physical  prototyping methods, it became obvious that it was very productive for our group. 

## Physical prototypes

### Mobile app prototype

was prototyped using a sponge that we carefully cut into pieces to create a placeholder for a screen. This screen could easily be changed to simulate user interactions. We used a bunch of styrofoam squares
to design different screens. It was very effective. 

### Wrist band foam prototype

In order to get a fell of the actual wrist band, we used styrofoam that we cut using a hot wire,
and then used smooth sand paper to give it a smooth and symmetric form. It was very interesting
to be able to wear the product and at the same time being able to interact with the app prototype.

## Role playing

But we felt that there was a lot of possibilities that we might have missed so we started
to role-play with lego, and oh boy, that was fun! After this realization, we build a combination 
between a cardboard model and lego model. It had 4 different areas that represented
different use-cases for our anti-stress band. A office, 


## I made a quick Arduino-node.js project

I love doing hardware hacks, and without reading the restrictions, I started
to build a quick rgb-led-arduino-node.js so that we could easily demonstrate
the different states of the wrist band. It was very effective.

## Redefined idea based on prototyping

We all have been stressed, it could be at work or at home. But as soon as we have the possibility 
to talk with a family member or a friend, everything starts to feel good againagain. What if your friends could see how stressed you are even if you are unable to talk with each other?

Let me introduce you to the Anti-stress band, a band that will analyze your pulse, sweat levels and
hormones and calculate how stressed you are. This will then be shared to a companion app on 
your phone so that your friends and family can react if you are too stressed. It will also have
a led matrix that will use a gradient between green and red to show the user how stressed he/she are.
